                # Welcome to the Providers System ðŸŽ‰\n\n

                Starting from **2.0.0**, the app will migrate from embedded providers to dynamic ones. This allows users to choose where and how to get content based on their preferences.\n\n

                ### Brief info about providers\n\n

                A provider, commonly known as _extension_, _source_ or _addon_, is an external feature that is separated from the app. It handles content generation such as media catalogs.\n\n

                For those familiar with _Cloudstream3_ and _Stremio_, this new dynamic provider system will feel right at home as it was mainly inspired by them. If you are new to this concept, **think of the app as a browser while the providers are the browser extensions**\n\n

                ### Author\'s note\n\n

                Thank you all for the great support around the app. I have been trying my best to be _motivated_ every day to push a commit, but, you know, sometimes _productivity_ is not really one of your friends so I apologize for the slow updates\n\n

                Let us keep growing (slowly pls ðŸ˜”ðŸ«µ) and keep the app alive and well!\n
